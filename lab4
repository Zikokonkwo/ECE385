#4 bit multiplier

/*
  B --> multiplier
    This determines we either add a shifted version of the multiplicand to the accumulator or just shift without adding
  A --> Accumulator
    Holds intermiediate results of the multiplication as we add/subtract. Should start at zero and accumulates shiftted multiplicand
    
  S --> Multiplicand
    Number we are multiplying by the multiplier. Remains unchanged throughout the process. Shifted left by one
  After we are done multiplying the result should be stored in the Accumulator and Multiplier together.
